Speechless

Here comes a wave meant wash me away
A tide that is taking me under
Swallowing sound left with nothing to say
My voice drowned out in a thunder 

But I won't cry and I won't start to crumble
Whenever they try to shut me and cut me down

I won't be silenced
You can't keep me quiet
Won't tremble when you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless

'Cause I breath when they try to soffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

Written in stone 
Every rule, every word
Centuries old and unbending
Stay in your place better seen and not heard
But now that story is ending
'Cause I. I cannot start to crumble
So come on and try. 
Try to shut me and cut me down

I won't .....

Let the storm in
I cannot be broken
No, I won't live unspoken
'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

Try to lock me in this cage
I won't just lay me down and die
I will take these broken wings and watch me burn across the sky
Hear the echo saying I
won't be silenced
Though you wanna see me tremble when you try it

All I know is I won't go speechless

'Cause I breath when they try to suffocate me
Don't you underestimate me
'Cause I know is I won't go speechless
