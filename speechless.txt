Speechless

Here comes the wave meant wash me away
A tide that is taken me under
Swallowing sound left and nothing to say
My voice is straund out in a thunder 
But I won't cry and I won't start to cranble
Whenever they try to shut me and cut me down
I won't be silence
You can't keep me qiet
Won't trabled it you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless



try to lock me in this cage

I won't be silenced
