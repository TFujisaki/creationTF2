Speechless

Here comes the wave meant wash me away
A tide that is taken me under
Swallowing sound left and nothing to say
My voice is straund out in a thunder 
But I won't cry and I won't start to cranble
Whenever they try to shut me and cut me down
I won't be silence
You can't keep me qiet
Will trabled if you try it
All I know is I won't go speechless

We'd in stone in word every word
Such a resort and bending
Stay in a place and in not heard
But now that story is ending
'Cause I. I cannot start to cramble
So come on and try. Try to shut me and cut me down

I won't .....

Let the storm in
No, I cannot be broken


try to lock me in this cage

I won't be silenced
